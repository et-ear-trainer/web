## ET - Ear Trainer
<br>

**Yet another ear-training app? Well, this one is different!**

Playing jazz, pop and improvised music means being able to quickly recognize and replay what you hear. The app focuses on microphone input and includes active and passive hearing. An integrated voicing generator ensures that piano voicings common in jazz practice are used. The app provides exercises for specific hearing problems, such as identifying root tones. Although this app began as an ear-training tool for students of jazz and pop at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), it is also intended for musicians playing in other styles, and at all levels. It was developed by Swiss IT specialist and jazz trumpeter Daniel Schenker, professor at ZHdK, in collaboration with his son Elia (19, Informatikmittelschule Hottingen in Zurich).
<br><br>

**How it works**

The app offers a host of ear-training exercises, many of them quite enjoyable, all designed to enhance both active and passive hearing. Active hearing means reproducing what you have heard on an instrument or with your voice, while passive hearing refers to the ability to identify such things as the scales, triads and four-note-chords, tensions and slash chords, on which active hearing is based. One of the features that makes our app so special is the fact that its microphone enables a sort of dialogue between the app and the musician – whether on voice, wind, string instruments, guitar, piano or electric bass. Unlike other apps, this one uses an integrated voicing generator to ensure that the chords played (position, voicing) correspond to the actual performance situation. In addition, the app uses a detailed educational guidance system, which allows users to individually customize the exercises. You can obtain over 190 achievements. Compete with other users and publish your high scores and trophies on the in-app leaderboard!
The app also offers an easy way to backup statistics and settings and transfer them to other devices.
<br><br>

**Active exercises (use of the microphone)**
- Imitating / singing notes of the first five notes of a major or minor scale; suitable for younger students or amateurs
- Diatonic imitation: reproduction of notes in a particular key, vocally or on an instrument
- Atonal imitation: improvement of relative or referential hearing
- Intervals
- Resolution game: technique for the improvement of downward interval singing or playing
- Bass imitation exercises: double bass notes and root notes of various chords are to be reproduced vocally or on an instrument, a central skill that is often underdeveloped
- Tensions imitation exercises: Re-sing or replay chord tensions of a given chord (#9, b13 for example, new in version 1.02)
- Scales sandbox: imitation practice in tonal spaces from over 40 different scales
- Tonal memory game
<br><br>

**Passive exercises (identification practice)**

- Melodic or harmonic Intervals, within an octave or greater than 1 octave.
- Triads/four-tone-chords in root position and inversion, as well as identification of top note positions
- Four-note-chords with one tension (17 types) and with two tensions (15 types)
- All 12 major and minor triads above a root tone (slash chords/hybrids)
- Identification of scales and modes
Depending on the setting, the chords can also be played arpeggiated.
- Chord progressions jazz and pop (diatonic in major and minor, modal interchange, modulations and others)
<br><br>

**For whom is the app intended?**

- Singers both amateur and professional who want to incorporate (noteless) aural imitation exercises into their practice programme. Enables practice of chords, scales, intervals and root notes of chords, vocally or on an instrument
- Musicians in primary and secondary school, musicians and singers preparing for university entrance exams (practical theory), and conservatory students
- Musicians and singers of all genres, especially jazz/pop/rock, who want to freshen up or expand their chord vocabulary
- Brass players: control in mouthpiece exercises (buzzing)

#title
Why yet another ear training app?
#text
Well, this app is different: It focuses on microphone input and includes active and passive hearing. An integrated voicing generator ensures that piano voicings common in jazz practice are used. The app provides exercises for specific hearing problems, such as identifying root tones.
This app began as an ear-training tool for students of jazz and pop at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) and is used in the two-year Ear Training course.

#title
Why ear training at all?
#text
According to American jazz trumpeter Tim Hagans, "Ear training is the overlooked activity with music." (July 2021).
Especially in jazz, in improvised music and interplay, the ability to quickly grasp and realize sounds is particularly important: How do I accompany a brass solo as a pianist, which voicings do I use? What do I sing in a cadenza over a certain chord played by the guitar? The goal is to realize music not by reading notes, but by what is heard internally, i.e. the ability to recognize, classify and realize conventional as well as rarely heard sounds as quickly as possible. In the playing situation I have no time to "calculate", I must be able to rely on my reflexes. The training of these reflexes needs a multiple of the time I need to understand the corresponding theory. The ability to self-reflect also plays a big role in ear training: How far does my intuition go? Where are the limits of my hearing skills? Which exercises can I use to develop my ears?

::faq-item
#title
What is meant by active and passive hearing? Why the distinction?
#text
Active hearing means reproducing what is heard on the instrument or with the voice, while passive hearing means identifying musical events such as scales, chords, tensions, and so on. In improvised music and interplay both abilities are necessary. The distinction allows for a subdivision of the methods.

::faq-item
#title
The app does not recognize my sound input, although the microphone seems to work and the volume indicator in the microphone window changes
#text
- Start playing/singing only when the microphone window is displayed
- The tone is not held long enough: Sing / play the tone with as constant intonation as possible, without vibrato, until the app gives a feedback (1-3 seconds). Pianos: hold key and/or press pedal.
- The tone is not sung / played accurately enough. If the sound input does also not work via an external piano, toggle to option "Easy"; if the problem is not solved: activate option "Practice mode".
- Select a quiet work environment
- For voice input, activate option "Sound input with voice".
- Change position and angle to smartphone: Depending on the model, different microphones exist (bottom, top next to cameras, back side, etc).

::faq-item
#title
The app does not recognize my sound input, the volume indicator in the microphone window (semicircle) shows no change
#text
- If you are using AirPods or similar: quit and restart the app
- Allow microphone access in smartphone settings: iOS: _Settings-Privacy-Microphone_, Android: _ET App-Permissions-Microphone_.
- Change position and angle to smartphone: Depending on the model, different microphones exist (bottom, top next to cameras, back side, etc).
- If the microphone still does not work: Quit and restart the app. If the problem is still unsolved: restart the smartphone.

::faq-item
#title
The app recognizes my sound input, but displays wrong octaves
#text
In rare cases, the problem can occur. What you can do:
- Try to change source volume, position and angle to smartphone
- Turn off "Exact octaves" button in main menu. The following exercises use the "exact octaves" setting: _Five-tone range_, _Imitation_, _major keys_, _Resolution Game_ and _Memory_.
::

::faq-item
#title
Does the app work with AirPods or other bluetooth headphones?
#text
Yes. Note: If AirPods are used on multiple devices, the microphone may stop working properly at times. If so, the volume indicator in the microphone window may not change. Workaround: quit and restart the app. Important: for quality reasons, the app records with the smartphone microphones exclusively.

::faq-item
#title
The identification of top note positions (triads and four-note chords) is difficult, I just can't get ahead there
#text
True! Although the sound generator plays the top note a bit louder, top note identification is not always easy with non-arpeggiated sounds.
- Choose a quiet working environment and use good headphones
- Listen to/practice arpeggiated voicings first - toggle to option "Easy"
- Tap on _statistics_ button and select, for example, only voicings with the root in the lead (only works with triads)

#title
The identification of top note positions (triads and four-note chords) is difficult, I just can't get ahead there
#text
The _Imitation, atonal_ exercise can be practiced in two different ways, it does not require absolute pitch:

1. Reference tone method (vertical hearing):
This method helps to develop the referential hearing and improves the ability to keep a reference tone in your ear for a longer time:
- If the "Easy" option is switched on, a "C" reference tone is played at the beginning. The reference tone depends on the transposition; transposition can be changed in the _settings_.
- Press the arrow, a tone is played; try to hear it in relation to the reference tone.
- Before each further query, try to recall the reference tone; if necessary, it can be replayed on the app keyboard.

2. Intervals (horizontal hearing):
- Each new note is derived from the last note by interval detection.

If the option "Exact octaves" is switched off, all notes can be played or sung within one octave.:
::

::faq-item
#title
Can the app help me to get absolute pitch?
#text
Yes and no. Perfect pitch is often overestimated and not a necessary aspect of what constitutes good hearing. In practice, sound memory and good referential hearing are more important: What degree of a scale am I on? Where are the steps in a minor or in the chromatic scale? The app exercises _Imitation Diatonic / Atonal, Resolution Game, Intervals, Sandbox Scales_ may help improve relative hearing.
It is not yet entirely clear whether absolute pitch is innate or acquired in infancy. However, you can train the ability to remember a specific, absolute reference tone. For example, singers might choose a middle "C", guitar players an "E" or "A" (string tuning), trumpets a "Bb" concert. The associated haptics (chord fingering, piano voicing, valve position) can help recalling the tone. Try to reproduce the reference tone often and try to keep it in your ear for as long as possible. - If the option "Easy" is set, the app plays such a reference tone before starting most active exercises.

::faq-item
#title
I am looking for assistance with mouthpiece buzzing - can the app help here?
#text
Yes. Since the app only recognizes reasonably consistent and well-intonated notes, it can help improve intonation and airflow when buzzing. Two exercises:
1. Simple exercise, range: 1 octave.
- Select _Imitation, major keys_. After the prompt, buzz any root note. The app will play random notes of that scale, which must be imitated. If the "Easy" option is set, the whole ascending scale has to be buzzed first.

2. More advanced exercise, trumpet:
- Select the "Bb" transposition in the settings.
- Set the "Easy" option
- Select the _Imitation, atonal_ exercise. The app plays a transposed "C" (Bb concert) as a reference note; when you start the exercise, the app plays random tones, which have to be imitated. For warm-ups, turn off the "Exact octaves" option, so the notes can be buzzed in any octave position.

::faq-item
#title
If I have "Autoplay" on and "Practice Mode" off, non-stop queries are being played, is there no option for a pause?
#text
Yes, there is: Just click on _Statistics_ and eventually return to the exercise. This interruption has no influence on the score (number of correct answers in a row).
::

::faq-item
#title
The chords are always played arpgeggiated, is it possible to hear them as a chord?
#text
Yes: Turn off the "Easy" option on the app's main page.
::

::faq-item
#title
I'm practicing major triads over bass tone; I use to replay the chords on my piano and get at D/G; but the app tells me that the correct solution is G/C?
#text
That is correct. For the 12 major and minor triads over bass, the app only distinguishes the basic types with respect to bass tone C, regardless which note they are effectively played from.
::

::faq-item
#title
I have a new phone and want to transfer my scores as well as settings - is that possible?
#text
Yes, this is very easy. Using the backup function (_settings_), high scores, app settings and statistics including chord selection settings can be downloaded to another device. The data (only app-internal data, no user details) is stored in the cloud. Upon successful storage (the cell phone must be connected to the Internet), a 10-digit, copyable code is shown. With this code, the data can be downloaded to the new phone (_settings, restore from backup_).
::

::faq-item
#title
I want to backup my scores and settings somewhere - is that possible?
#text
Yes, this is very easy. With the _Create backup_ function (_Settings_), high scores, app settings and statistics including chord selection settings can be saved in the cloud. Upon successful saving (the phone must be connected to the internet), a 10-digit, copyable code is shown. This code can be used to restore the data later.
::

::faq-item
#title
When I turn my phone 90 degrees, nothing happens - is that correct?
#text
That's right, the app uses portrait format for smartphones; iPads also allow landscape format.

::faq-item
#title
Is the app also available for desktop computers?
#text
Yes. The Mac version is available in the App Store, Windows versions can be ordered using the contact form.
Keyboard shortcuts: Space bar: Start exercise, R: Repeat, S: Shuffle, CMD-F (Mac), F11 (Windows): Toggle full screen mode.
MIDI input is supported.

**Inside Limmattal, Thomas Pfann, November 2022 - Portrait about Daniel and Elia Schenker (german)**

:read-article{:link="press/Portrait-Dani-Elia-Inside-Limmattal-Nov2022.pdf"}

**Schweizer Musikzeitung, Andreas Chr. Szalatnay , 24.11.2021**

Daniel Schenker's ear training app can be used to train active and passive listening. It is mainly focused on jazz, pop and improvised music, but by far not only.

If we remember our first contact with ear training as a school discipline, we usually think back to the first courses at the conservatory, in which individuals had perfect pitch, but most still heard absolutely nothing. To do justice to this scattering of talents was the greatest challenge for lecturers in frontally offered lessons. In the ear training application ET-Ear Trainer, developed at the Zurich University of the Arts under the direction of the jazz trumpeter and IT specialist Daniel Schenker, the users themselves make the individual adjustments to the respective learning level in the clear basic settings. If the "Easy" checkbox is activated, a number of parameters such as playback tempo, reference tone specification or response time of the tasks are changed in favor of the learners.

At the beginning of the exercise sequence, one of 21 subject areas can be selected. From diatonic imitation to recognizing four-notes over a bass note including tensions to tapping the correct scale, the individual menus offer plenty of material and challenge. Accurate listening, recognition, imitation, analysis and memorization are equally trained and encouraged in a structured way. The scope of the app's content and the required terms make it clear that it is not possible to simply train while playing, but that the basic knowledge has to be acquired beforehand or in parallel. Only the not generally known "Resolution Game" for interval determination is explained with note examples. The target audience is primarily music students at technical colleges. For younger students or amateurs, the program should be supplemented, for example, with tetrachords or five-tone spaces. Also, harmonic connections (cadences) with corresponding voice-leadings or polyphonic listening are still completely missing.

Since the app in the present version 1.02 (on the iPhone S) can only be operated in portrait mode, errors creep in again and again when tapping the displayed keys. Also, the relatively sluggishly reacting on-screen keyboard does not allow rhythmically correct playback in the memory game. The ten interactive exercises, which are controlled via the microphone, are therefore much more fun. Although the microphone flashes somewhat hesitantly, it reacts very subtly to what is played, and voice as well as wind or string instruments and piano reliably trigger the corrective reaction of the device up to octave determination. Caution: in exam mode, the three seconds between question and answer choice can be cheatingly abused to quickly approach the solution before it is scored. In the demanding mode, the scales are played very quickly, whereby the tone lengths are unfortunately not adapted to the tempo. Thus, two three notes blur into a cluster, which makes listening even more difficult.

The design of the app comes across as very simple and purposefully clear. It is not a game, but a learning application! The fact that after a short time quite a few improvements like the explanation tour (including links to Youtube clips in German or English) or the replay button could be included, gives hope that the app will appeal to an ever broader community. It is not only highly recommended to improvising musicians, but also to performers and composers who can achieve more precision in performance and memory with the Ear Trainer.
