    <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Backup Data</h3>
    The app does not collect any data automatically. The only data that is collected by the app, is the data which is used when uploading a backup. The backup will be uploaded to a database.
    The backup consists of settings, the statistic, highscores and a unique id assigned randomly to each device. The unique id is generated, so that the server can know which device created which backup.
    <h3>1.2 Microphone Data</h2>
    The data recorded from the microphone is only used when the microphone window is visible in the app. The microphone data will only be used for pitch detection and not be uploaded to any server.
    <h3>1.3 Leaderboard Data</h3>
    The app does not collect any data automatically. After registering with a user name, only this username, the users country, top highscore and his number of trophies are uploaded to a database.  The registration can be unsubscribed at any time.
